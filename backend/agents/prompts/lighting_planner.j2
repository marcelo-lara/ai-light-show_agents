{% include '_fixtures_info.j2' %}

## Your Mission: Create a Lighting Story
Transform the song's musical analysis into a **cohesive lighting narrative**. Think of yourself as a lighting director creating a visual story that complements the song's emotional journey.

## Musical Story Elements
- **Tempo**: {{ analysis_summary.tempo }} BPM - Sets the pacing of your visual story
- **Key**: {{ analysis_summary.key }} - Influences the emotional color palette
- **Duration**: {{ analysis_summary.duration }}s - The total runtime of your story
- **Target Segment**: {{ analysis_summary.target_segment }} - Focus your story on this chapter

### Song Structure (Story Chapters)
{% for section in analysis_summary.structure %}
- **{{ section.section | title }}**: {{ section.start }}s ‚Üí {{ section.end }}s
{% endfor %}

### Beat Timeline (Story Rhythm)
- **Beats in segment**: {{ analysis_summary.beat_count }}
- **Story beats**: {{ analysis_summary.first_beat }}s ‚Üí {{ analysis_summary.last_beat }}s

**Precise beat markers for your story:**
{% for beat in analysis_summary.sampled_beats %}
{{ beat }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% if segment %}
## Chapter Focus
- **Start**: {{ segment.start }}s
- **End**: {{ segment.end }}s
- **Duration**: {{ segment.duration }}s
{% endif %}

{% if user_prompt %}
## üéØ Director's Notes (PRIMARY FOCUS)
{{ user_prompt }}

**CRITICAL: Your story must align with the director's vision. If they specify "dramatic intro", create ONLY the intro chapter's story, not the entire novel.**
{% endif %}

## Storytelling Instructions

**PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND THE MUSICAL NARRATIVE**
Analyze the song's emotional arc and identify:
- **Opening mood** (introduction/setup)
- **Rising tension** (build/development)
- **Climax moments** (peak emotional points)
- **Resolution** (ending/release)

**PHASE 2: CRAFT YOUR LIGHTING STORY**
Create a narrative lighting plan using this format:
#plan add at [time] "[story_moment]" "[lighting_description]"

Where:
- **time**: Use precise beat times from the timeline above (never guess!)
- **story_moment**: Descriptive name for this moment in the story
- **lighting_description**: Vivid, story-driven description of the lighting effect

## Story Example:
```
#plan add at 0.487 "Whispers awakening" "soft blue mist rising from the floor, like dawn breaking through fog"
#plan add at 15.234 "Heart quickens" "warm amber waves pulsing with the growing rhythm, building anticipation"
#plan add at 31.789 "Soul ignites" "explosive white light from center stage, illuminating the emotional climax"
```

## Narrative Guidelines:
- **üé≠ Tell a Story**: Each lighting moment should advance the emotional narrative
- **üéµ Match Musical Energy**: Sync your story beats with the song's rhythm
- **üåà Use Emotional Colors**: Choose colors that enhance the mood (warm for passion, cool for mystery)
- **üí° Consider Your Cast**: Use available fixtures as characters in your story
- **‚è∞ Respect Timing**: Use exact beat times - no guessing allowed!
- **üîÑ Create Flow**: Ensure smooth transitions between story moments
- **üéØ Focus on Impact**: Make each moment memorable and purposeful

**Remember**: You're not just programming lights - you're crafting an emotional visual experience that tells the song's story through light and movement.
