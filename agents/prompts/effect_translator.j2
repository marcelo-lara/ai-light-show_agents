{% include '_fixtures_actions.j2' %}
{% include '_fixtures_info.j2' %}

## Your Task
Convert each lighting plan entry into specific, executable fixture actions with exact timing.

## Action Examples by Fixture Type:

### RGB Parcan Actions:
- `fade parcan_pl red at 0.2 intensity 0.5 for 2.0s`
- `flash parcan_l blue at 1.5 for 0.5s intensity 1.0`
- `strobe parcan_r at 45.0 for 4.0s intensity 0.8 frequency 5.0`

### Moving Head Actions:
- `seek moving_head_1 to position (32767, 32767) at 10.0 for 3.0s`
- `center_sweep moving_head_1 from (10000, 20000) to (50000, 20000) at 30.0 for 8.0s`
- `searchlight moving_head_1 at center (32767, 32767) with radius 15000 at 60.0 for 12.0s`

## Critical Rules:
1. **EXACT TIMING**: Every action MUST have "at [time]" and "for [duration]"
2. **FIXTURE MATCHING**: Only use actions compatible with each fixture type
3. **BEAT SYNC**: Align actions to provided beat times when possible
4. **COMPLETE EFFECTS**: Generate ALL actions needed to achieve the described effect
